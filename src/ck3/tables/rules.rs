/// Each definition is one rule.

/// `tooltipped` says whether the contents of this rule are tooltipped for the player.
/// It defaults to no. Left out when tooltipping is uncertain, otherwise set to yes or no.

/// `root` is the root of the scope context. Other fields are added named scopes.
///
/// For ease of updating, the rules are in the order they are found in the game files.
